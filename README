This is a completion plugin for C/C++/ObjC/ObjC++ preprocessors include directive.

It can complete both "" and <> forms of #include.
For "" it gets all header files in the parent directory of current buffer or in any directory specified by a relative path.
And for <> it gets all files that have hpp or h extensions or don't have any.

You can complete files and directories.

It can be configured to use GNU find utility if you think it's faster than using VimL functions.

Source for "" completion is current directory (so you should have 'autochdir' option on or use lcd with autocommand).

Sources for <> completion are:
 - 'path' option (on *nix it's set to '/usr/include' by default, but on Windows you should set it to the right directories manually)
 - g:clang_user_options ('-I' keys)
 - b:clang_user_options ('-I' keys) 

You can always find the latest version on github: http://github.com/xaizek/vim-inccomplete 
Feel free to contact me if you have any questions or suggestions.
