This is a completion plugin for C/C++/ObjC/ObjC++ preprocessors include directive.

It can complete both \"\" and <> forms of #include.
For \"\" it gets all header files in the current directory (so it&#039s assumed that you have something similar to \"autocmd BufEnter,BufWinEnter * lcd %:p:h\" in your .vimrc).
And for <> it gets all files that have hpp or h extensions or don&#039t have any.

Only files of include directories are displayed in completion list, but you can complete files in subdirectories of include directories too. All you need is to call completion again after typing subdirectory name and slash (and maybe beginning of file name).

It uses GNU find utility to find header files.

You could always find the latest version on github: http://github.com/xaizek/vim-inccomplete
